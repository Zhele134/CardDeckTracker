# My Personal Project

## Hearthstone Card Maker and Deck Tracker

This application will let the user be able to **make their custom Hearthstone Cards**, as well as **make decks**
with these cards. The user will create cards by first selecting the card type (minion, spell, weapon, etc.), then
adding their stats and properties (attack, health, cost, tribe, etc.). The application will render a picture
of the card based on their stats, emulating the style of Hearthstone cards. These cards will be saved in an overall
database for later use. Finally, the user will be able to create Hearthstone decks from these cards, being able to add 
and remove cards to a deck. These decks will also be saved for future use. 

Any user with an interest in Hearthstone can use this application.

This project is of interest for me because Hearthstone is a game I really enjoy, and drafting up decks with
my card library is a fun aspect of the game for me. In addition, there's a sub-community of Hearthstone I enjoy called
"Custom Hearthstone Cards", where players can draft up ideas for unofficial cards in the game. Making this application 
can make it easier to draft up concepts of these cards, allowing me to contribute more to that community.
